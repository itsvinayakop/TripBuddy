# TripBuddy
A swift playground app to plan travel itinerary
Around 22% of the world travellers found it difficult to plan a trip 
because they do not know about the famous locations of the city 
and are not aware of their cultures.
Trip Buddy is a trailblazing travel companion app designed to 
revolutionise the way users explore new cities and destinations. 
While the current version serves as a dummy or trial, our vision is to 
expand its availability to every city and country globally, ensuring an 
indispensable tool for all avid travellers
Key Features:
• City Selection: Users can currently choose their destination 
city, previewing the app's potential for a global reach.
• Famous Places View: The app offers a sneak peek into its 
future capabilities, providing detailed information about each

• Itinerary Planning: Although in the trial phase, users can 
seamlessly plan their journeys by selecting multiple places, 
creating a personalized itinerary.
Future Prospects:
Trip Buddy aims to become a comprehensive travel guide, offering
